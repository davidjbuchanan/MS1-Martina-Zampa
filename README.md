services and or information via a newsletter. The FPT is based in New York city and as such the site supplies locations as rendezvous points for fictitious products.  


## UX

The webite was designed for the purpose of the Code Institute's User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project Submission. The brief required a multi-page responsive design that gave the user a positive user experience whilst allowing the to intuitively navigate the site. The inclusion of information, links, imagery and layout were designed to acheive this goal.
The target users are listed below:

<ul>
<li>Type (1) A potential client looking to compare and contrast potential personal trainers for the purpose of soliciting their skills. A visually attractive 'home' page  with a simple callout invites the browser to easily navigate to see skills on the 'about' page; and options on the 'products' page. Thus allowing them to make an informed decision prior to engaging in contact with the FPT.</li>

<li>Type (2) A potential client commited to contacting the FPT in order to establish contact and initiate a professional relationship. Further more this user type would 
want specific information regarding the venues / geographical locations which would be facilitated by the links on the 'services' page.</li>  

<li>Type (3) An existing client looking to establish a social relationship either with the FPT or similar user type as themselve. This would be acheived by accessing the social links at 
the footer of all pages.</li>
</ul>
